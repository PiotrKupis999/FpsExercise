FPS Prototype

- Objects have their strength on them,
- Material is not related to the material class built into Unity, but determines what an object is physically made of,
- The player moves like in a classic FPS,
- The player has 3 different weapons - each weapon is specified what type of object it destroys and how much damage it does
- When the player aims at an object he can destroy it if the weapon he is currently wielding has the ability to damage a certain type of material,

Video.mp4 shows how the game works.

Project made in Unity 2021.3.5
